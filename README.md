# X-Ray anomaly detection

<<<<<<< HEAD
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data/data

For the resnet classifier for the NIH data set
=======

If you wish to run train/run the models for yourself, you must download the dataset from kaggle.
NIH Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data/data

After downloading the dataset from kaggle, you should have a large file called archive which contains the images as well as the CSV file and any other files that were included in the kaggle dataset.

### For DenseNet
The DenseNet model is in the Jupyter Notebook named project.ipynb. In order for it to run, project.ipynb must be in a folder along with the unzipped archive folder. Do not put project.ipynb in archive or you will have to change the file path for many things.
